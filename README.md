2. It should be responsive (the content that is shown to the user should be appropriate based on user’s device resolution). 
3. The website should have at least the following pages: Home, About Us and Contact Us. Any other pages will be based on the business needs. For example, a restaurant’s website need a page about the menu, whereas a beauty salon’s website need a page  about the services that they offered.
